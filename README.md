# CDS DS 561 - Cloud Computing

_Professor: [Leonidas Kontothanassis](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/profile/kthanasi/)  
Semester: Fall 2023_

This repository contains my submissions for the assignments in CDS DS 561: Cloud Computing. Each assignment is contained in its own directory. The README for each assignment contains the assignment description and instructions for running the code.

_Assignment 1 is missing due to it being a simple introduction to GCP that did not require any code or scripts._
